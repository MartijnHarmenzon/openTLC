# openTLC
An open source traffic light control program.

## Background
MAPtm has started to develop a new generation of traffic light control programs: the so called openTLC programs. The concept is to optimise traffic conditions by using traffic policies and various data sources. The openTLC will be openly developed by a community of road authorities, traffic professionals and programming enthusiasts. Key words to describe an openTLC program are: open, community, uniform, transparent, safety, self-learning, modular, flexible and object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Software
We use [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) as our programming language of choice and 
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as its IDE. [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/start.html) is used for the 
various configuration files and [JSON](http://www.json.org/) for the APIs.
